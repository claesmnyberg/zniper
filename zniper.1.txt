NAME
       zniper - Display and reset TCP connections

SYNOPSIS
       zniper [-hnpsvV] [-b color] [-B color] [-f color] [-i iface] [-l file]

DESCRIPTION
       zniper  displays  TCP  connections seen by the first available interface, or the one specified with -i option.
       The connections displayed can be reseted by injecting RST  packets  into  the  stream.  Connections  initiated
       before zniper was started is also detected (unless -s option is used on the command line), these are displayed
       marked as 'Old' since the client sending the initial SYN packet is not known.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -b color
           Background color, defaults to black.

       -B color
           Border color, defaults to green.

       -f color
           Foreground color, defaults to white.

       -h
           Display short summary of commandline options.

       -i iface
           Specify the interface to listen on.

       -l file
           Log status information to file file.  A nice way of logging detected connections.

       -n
           Do not attempt to resolve hostnames.

       -s
           Require the initial SYN packet for a connection to be displayed.

       -V
           Print version and exit.

       -p
           Do not put the interface in promiscous mode.  Note that the interface might be in promiscous mode for some
           other reason, why you might receive "all" packets seen anyway.
